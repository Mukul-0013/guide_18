              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Contracts are legally binding agreements that you'll encounter throughout your life. Here's what you
                should know:
              </p>
  
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-6">
                <li className="mb-2">Always read the entire contract before signing</li>
                <li className="mb-2">Don't be afraid to ask questions about terms you don't understand</li>
                <li className="mb-2">Be aware of cancellation policies and penalties</li>
                <li className="mb-2">Keep copies of all signed contracts</li>
                <li>Know that verbal agreements can sometimes be legally binding</li>
              </ul>
  
              <p className="text-gray-700 italic">
                Remember: If something seems too good to be true in a contract, it probably is. Take your time and
                consider seeking legal advice for important agreements.

                Note that tenant laws vary by state and locality. Research the specific laws that apply to your area.

                your area.
