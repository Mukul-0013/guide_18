            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              SafeStart was founded in 2020 by a group of educators, legal professionals, and safety experts who
              recognized the need for accessible, reliable information for young adults transitioning to independence.
              What began as a small community workshop has grown into a comprehensive online platform serving thousands of
              young adults nationwide.
